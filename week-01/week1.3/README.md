# Week 1.3 – Loops, Functions, and Callback Functions 🚀

Welcome to Week 1.3 of the 36-Week JavaScript Challenge! This module dives into the core logic building blocks of JavaScript — Loops, Functions, and Callback Functions. These concepts are essential to write clean, reusable, and efficient code.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🔁 Loops
Loops allow us to run a block of code multiple times until a specific condition is met. Different types of loops serve different use cases:

- `for` loop – great for a known number of iterations
- `while` loop – runs as long as the condition is true
- `do...while` loop – similar to while, but runs at least once
- `for...of` – ideal for iterating over arrays
- `for...in` – used for iterating over object properties
- `break` and `continue` – control loop flow

### 🛠️ Functions
Functions help group code into reusable blocks. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens — they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

Key concepts:
- Function Declaration
- Function Expression
- Parameters vs. Arguments
- Return Values
- Reusability and DRY Principle

### 🔄 Callback Functions
A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function to be "called back" later.

Why use callbacks?
- Asynchronous operations (e.g., setTimeout, API calls)
- Customize behavior of functions
- Enhance flexibility and control flow

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Loops are essential for repeating tasks efficiently.
- Functions help in writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- Callbacks make JavaScript flexible and asynchronous — a core part of JS event handling and APIs.

---

## ✅ Practice Tasks

- Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd.
- Use a `for...of` loop to iterate through an array of names.
- Create a function that takes another function as a parameter (callback) and calls it after processing.
- Use `setTimeout()` with a callback to simulate delayed action.
