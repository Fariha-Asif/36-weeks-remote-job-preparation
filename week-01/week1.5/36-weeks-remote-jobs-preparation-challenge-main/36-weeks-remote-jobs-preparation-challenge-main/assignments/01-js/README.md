## 🌱 Easy Level

### 1. 🔄 Anagram Check
**Description:**  
Check if two words are anagrams — i.e., they contain the same characters but in a different order.  
**Concepts Learned:**  
- String comparison  
- `.split()`, `.sort()`, `.join()` methods  
- Logical thinking

**Example:**
```js
isAnagram("listen", "silent"); // true


2. 📊 Expenditure Analysis
Description:
Given an array of monthly expenses, calculate the total, average, highest, and lowest expenditures.
Concepts Learned:

Array traversal

Math functions: Math.max(), Math.min()

Accumulator patterns

Example:
calculateStats([1000, 2000, 3000]);
// Output: { total: 6000, average: 2000, max: 3000, min: 1000 }

3. 🔍 Find Largest Element
Description:
Find the largest number in a given array.
Concepts Learned:

Array iteration

Use of Math.max()

Spread operator ...

Example:
findMax([1, 5, 2, 9]); // Output: 9

📘 Medium Level
4. 🔡 Count Vowels
Description:
Count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present in a string, regardless of case.
Concepts Learned:

String traversal

Case normalization with .toLowerCase()

Membership check with .includes()

Example:
countVowels("Javascript"); // Output: 3

5. 🔁 Palindrome Checker
Description:
Check if a string reads the same forward and backward.
Concepts Learned:

String reversal

.split(), .reverse(), .join()

Comparison logic

Example:
isPalindrome("madam"); // Output: true

6. ⏱️ Times Table Generator
Description:
Generate a multiplication table for a given number.
Concepts Learned:

Looping (for loop)

Template literals

Simple mathematical logic

Example:
generateTable(5);
// Output: "5 x 1 = 5" to "5 x 10 = 50"

🔥 Hard Level
7. 🧮 Calculator App
Description:
A simple calculator supporting operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Concepts Learned:

Event handling (if built for UI)

Conditional logic or switch statements

Functional decomposition

Example:
calculate(4, '+', 2); // Output: 6

8. ✅ To-Do List App
Description:
Create a simple to-do list that can add, remove, and display tasks.
Concepts Learned:

Arrays and object manipulation

DOM manipulation (if UI version)

CRUD operations

Example:
addTask("Study JavaScript");
deleteTask(0);
displayTasks();
